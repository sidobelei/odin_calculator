# calculator

The purpose of this project was to create a simple functional calculator. 

This is a culmination of everything we've learned so far about HTML, CSS and Javascript. The structure of the calculator was styled using flex box. Event listeners were used to store values and perform mathematical operations.And with DOM manipulation the different buttons each change colors according to their function.
